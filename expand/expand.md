1. 
    a. Because the interpreter could sometimes interpret the variable type as an unwanted variable type and cause bug in a program.
    b. When reviewing the code, the programmers have to identify the varibale type on their own.
    c. Could lead to type conversion issues.
2. Maybe when building a website there could be many places that require user output and these ouptuts could potentially mess up the code logic. So for simplification, the developers just make it all loosely typed. It allows the program to start a long-running taks and still be able to be responsivge to other events.
3. A compiled language compile a program into machine-language instructions before execution, while an interpreted langauge execute instructions directly and freely. Interpreted. Adavantage is it is easy for debugging; disadvantage is that it is less efficient than compiled language.
4. A basis is more important than any framework. Once the basis is understood, it is much easier to build up from the previous knowledge. Benefits of that is understanding javascript is part of understanding a new langauge. Drawback is that most development process nowadays use framework so this means we have to learn a new tool.
5. I think this lab teaches me how to debug using Devtool which is really helpfuls. I will be cautious about type conversion issues while working on my own project.
